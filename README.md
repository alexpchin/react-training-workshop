# React Workshop
This is a bunch of code and notes for day long React workshops in London. [Tickets are still available!](http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2016/02/react-workshops-london).

# Getting Started

Firstly, clone this repository.

Then, run `npm install` (this might take some time, there's lots to download!).

Then, run this command in one tab:

```
npm run webpack
```

And then in another tab, run:

```
npm run serve
```

This will open up `localhost:3001` and give you access to all the exercises.

# Lesson Order

There's a load of notes in `lessons/` that map to exercises. The order they should be done is as follows:

- lessons/introductions.md (uses the `beginning/` folder)
- lessons/react-router-lessons.md
- lessons/communication-redux-lessons.md
- lessons/testing-react-lessons.md
- lessons/final-lessons.md

### Credits

A lot of this content was taken / inspired by other publically available examples / repositories online.

- [react-training](https://github.com/ryanflorence/react-training) by Ryan Florence has some great examples; the store example (`middle/2`) is taken largely from that.
- [The React Docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) are obviously an invaluable resource when putting together React teaching materials.
